Our one server web infrastructure will have the following components:

  1.Server: A server is a computer that provides services to other computers or devices on a network.

  2.Domain name: A domain name is the human-readable name that identifies a website. It is used to help users find and access the website. In this case, the domain name is foobar.com.

  3.DNS record: A DNS record is a configuration that maps a domain name to an IP address. In this case, the www record for foobar.com points to the IP address of the server (8.8.8.8).

  4.Web server: Nginx is a popular web server that will handle the initial HTTP request from the user's browser and serve static content such as HTML, CSS, and images.

  5.Application server: The application server will handle dynamic content such as server-side rendering of web pages and API requests. It will be running the code base of the application.

  6.Database: MySQL is a popular open-source database management system that will store and retrieve data for our web application.

Issues with this infrastructure:

  1.Single point of failure (SPOF): Since all the components are hosted on a single server, any failure or downtime will cause the entire website to be unavailable.

  2.Downtime during maintenance: Whenever there is a need for maintenance, such as deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted, causing downtime for the website.

  3.Inability to scale: If there is a sudden surge in incoming traffic, the single server may not be able to handle the load, causing t
