Issues with this infrastructure:

    1.Single point of failure (SPOF): The Nginx load balancer on server 1 is a single point of failure. If it goes down, incoming traffic will not be distributed, causing the website to be unavailable.

    2.Security issues: There is no firewall or HTTPS configured, which could lead to potential security vulnerabilities.

    3.No monitoring: There is no monitoring set up to track the performance of the infrastructure, which could lead to downtime and other issues going unnoticed.
